# WomenTechstersProject
Capstone Project

This project is a web-based application designed to enhance the process of identifying skilled artisans while providing an avenue for artisans to display their skills and abilities to find jobs.

LOGIN PAGE:
This page is being generated under the following assumptions:
1. The only way through which artisans can have a profile is if the managing company of the website create their initial profile after they have signed a contract with them.
2. For future works, the contract will be signed with an interview remotely and the profile can be created by a potential "sign up" on the login page.
3. There are currently already prospective artisans whose profiles have been created.

ADMIN PAGE:
1. At the moment, the admin is the sole member of the team that can add on new participants to the artisan section or the client section.
2. The Admin will login in and go straight to the updates of artisans and clients.
